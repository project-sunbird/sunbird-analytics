It was the Annual Haircut Day for Sringeri Srinivas.
All of us went to the Dasara Fair.
Sringeri Srinivas left home as usual to go to the local barber.
Papa bought Chintu fancy glasses. Mother bought me a bright blue cap. The baby got sugar candy.
But the barber said, "Today, I have no time to cut such long hair!"
On the way home, a very strong wind came. It blew my cap away.
Feeling sad, Sringeri Srinivas went back home to ask his wife for help.
My cap got stuck on a branch of the old Pipal tree.
I cried a lot. And I did not eat my dinner.
But his wife said, "Today, I have no time to cut such long hair!"
Later that night, the moon came up. It looked at my cap on the old Pipal tree.
Feeling a little angry, Sringeri Srinivas went to his friend, the tailor.
But the tailor said, "Today, I have no time to cut such long hair!"
It tried on my cap. The moon smiled happily. I smiled too.
Now a little worried, Sringeri Srinivas went to one more friend, the carpenter.
After school the next day, my mother gave me a shiny new red cap."The moon sent it," she said.
That night, both the moon and I wore our caps and smiled. We were happy.
But the carpenter said, "Today, I have no time to cut such long hair!"
Do you think the sun needs a hat?.
Poor Sringeri Srinivas. It seemed no one would cut his hair on this Annual Haircut Day.
In tears, he walked off by himself past the village forest.
He sat near a cave and cried loudly.
"The day is nearly over. How can I keep my promise to cut my hair? Oh God, help me!"
The tiger sleeping peacefully inside the cave was very disturbed by all the noise.
He came out, roaring, waving his giant paws at Sringeri Srinivas.
Poor Sringeri Srinivas was so scared, so scared, so scared that ...
... all the hair fell off his head!
Sringeri Srinivas ran all the way back to the village. The tiger went back to sleep.
Now, Sringeri Srinivas will not need a haircut for a very long time.
